# What interests me about Tim Ferriss
My dad first told me about Tim around 2009. He said something to the effect of this guy is a life hacker and he thinks out of the box and is really interesting. I bought his Four Hour Body because I wanted to get in crazy shape in preparation to going to the Marines. I thought his case studies in that book were awesome and I liked the way he though about problems. For example he examines how one would you go from running 5K to 50K in 12 Weeks. His process for tackling a big goal like this is to find experts in the field or find people who have achieved unexpected results and he reverse engineers what they did and tries to come up with a formula or protocol. I loved how he tackled big questions and goals. 

He went on to write other books and and currently does a podcast where he expounds on this formula of interviewing experts and people who had achieved ridiculous results and synthesizing their advice down to formulas and protocols. For me he is the OG life hacker and has inspired me to set big goals and think though the steps to achieve them.
