Wrote the INCERTO. Incerto means uncertainty or doubt in Latin.
It is made up of 5 books of which I have read 2,"Antifragile" and "Skin in the Game." These are fascinating books. Antifragile talks about how great strength and resiliency comes from many trials and errors. Someone who is fragile is someone who hasnt tried a bunch of things and is scared of failure, because one failure could ruin them. Someone who is Antifragile is someone who has tried and failed many times and grows stronger and wiser with each trial they face.



 Skin in the Game deals with decision making and evaluating people motives. It says to be wary of "experts." He who gives out advice but is not effected by the outcome of the advice is not to be trusted, because they stand to lose nothing if wrong. People who face the consequences of their own decision making will get better over time, because they feel the pain if they are mistaken. It follows that problems will arise when the decision makers are disconnected from consequences of their decisions. 
 
 [Hammurabi recognized the value of having “skin in the game” before it was a metaphor.](https://chiefexecutive.net/three-lessons-ceos-can-learn-king-hammurabi/#:~:text=Hammurabi%20recognized%20the%20value%20of,his%20code%20treated%20building%20construction.)

 > According to law number 232, if a Babylonia builder built a house using sub-par materials and for that reason the collapsed causing the death of the owner, the builder would be put to death. Harsh consequences, yes, but presumably Babylonian structures were built with quality materials and attention to detail because builders knew the consequences of default. When the parties to an agreement have real skin in the game, they care more about fairness and outcomes.
 



More on the Incerto, according to Amazon:
[The Incerto is an investigation of opacity, luck, uncertainty, probability, human error, risk, and decision making when we don’t understand the world, expressed in the form of a personal essay with autobiographical sections, stories, parables, and philosophical, historical, and scientific discussions, in non-overlapping volumes that can be accessed in any order. The main thread is that while there is inordinate uncertainty about what is going on, there is great certainty as to what one should do about it.](https://www.amazon.com/Incerto-Deluxe-Randomness-Procrustes-Antifragile/dp/198481981X/)

The above image doesn't help explain the Incerto but gives context to the topics mentioned in the series

Beware of black swan events. Seems statistically impossible, but happen more often than you think. If we look at the past to try to predict the future we will be 90% right but there is always a chance that something unprecendented happens. A black swan is an unpredictable event that is beyond what is normally expected of a situation and has potentially severe consequences. Some examples are the rise of the Internet, the personal computer, World War I, the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.
