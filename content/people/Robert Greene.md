# What interests me about Robert Greene
I was given Robert Greene's book "48 Laws of Power" at some point in the Marines. I started reading through it and was blown away. It is not an outright self help book and it does not take a moral or ethical stance. It is more of an examination of lessons learned with historical case studies behind each "lesson" or law. At the time I was desperately trying to make sense of my situation within the Marine Corps. I had experienced some some unforeseen setbacks and was trying to find my footing and this book helped me realize that I had made some classic mistakes and the powers that be crushed me. Looking back I did not have any street smarts, I thought if I work hard and have a good attitude I will go far. But I came to find out that there are many dynamics at play when one is trying to rise through the ranks of any organization. These dynamics can be seen as off putting because we wish the world was different and more fair but the world is not how we think it ought to be. If we are to change unfair power dynamics we must first understand the laws of power and be wary. I highly recommend this to anyone how has a boss.

Robert Greene has written masterpieces that seem to be timeless. I enjoy how he explores rough subjects and gives insight into the human psyche and feel like more people should explore his work.

Wrote "The 48 Laws of Power", "The Art of Seduction", "The 33 Strategies of War", "The 50th Law", "Mastery", and "The Laws of Human Nature". These books are masterpieces. A few prisons have banned these books because the subject matter is about manipulation. Greene's thinking on this is that you need to know about manipulation inorder to not be manipulated, I agree with this. Again each of these books are masterpieces and I recommend these books but they are alot to digest. 

With "The 48 Laws of Power" many of the laws rub me the wrong way but its written from the mindset of how to attain power. To me some of the laws seem dated or seem to be written from Greene's personal experience and are less relevant to the broader audience. However there are some timeless truths revealed and I find these these laws make appearances in subtle and not so subtle ways in my daily life.
