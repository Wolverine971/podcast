Great Tweet

Wrote "The 48 Laws of Power", "The Art of Seduction", "The 33 Strategies of War", "The 50th Law", "Mastery", and "The Laws of Human Nature". These books are masterpieces. A few prisons have banned these books because the subject matter is about manipulation. Greene's thinking on this is that you need to know about manipulation inorder to not be manipulated, I agree with this. Again each of these books are masterpieces and I recommend these books but they are alot to digest. 

With "The 48 Laws of Power" many of the laws rub me the wrong way but its written from the mindset of how to attain power. To me some of the laws seem dated or seem to be written from Greene's personal experience and are less relevant to the broader audience. However there are some timeless truths revealed and I find these these laws make appearances in subtle and not so subtle ways in my daily life.
