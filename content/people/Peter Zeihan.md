# Who is Peter Zeihan
Peter Zeihan is an expert on international relations and geopolitical analysis. He is the author of several books on these topics, including "The Accidental Superpower" and "Disunited Nations." In his work, Zeihan discusses the role of geography, energy resources, and demographics in shaping global politics and economics.

# What interests me about Peter Zeihan
Peter had some interesting hot takes on geopolitics that I had not heard before. He does many presentations and is well rehearsed and I don't agree with some of what he says, however he is knowledgeable and presents good arguments that are worth checking out.

# Notes and resources

Zeihan argues that the world is undergoing a major shift in the balance of power, with the United States losing its dominant position as other countries rise in influence. He believes that the 21st century will be characterized by a shift from a unipolar world dominated by the United States to a multipolar world in which several countries and regions will have significant influence.

Zeihan also discusses the role of energy in shaping global politics, arguing that access to energy resources will continue to be a major factor in international relations. He believes that the United States' increasing energy independence will give it more flexibility in its foreign policy and make it less reliant on other countries for resources.

Overall, Zeihan's work focuses on understanding the complex and dynamic factors that shape global politics and how they are likely to evolve in the future.
