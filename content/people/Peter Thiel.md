# Lessons from Peter Thiel
[Joe Lonsdale](https://joelonsdale.com/) | April 11, 2010

[Pulled from Blog Article](https://joelonsdale.com/lessons-peter-thiel/)

The nine lessons:

#### **1. Divide reasoning into separate parts and clearly identify the most important factor.**

#### **2. Don’t divide your attention: focusing on one thing yields increasing returns for each unit of effort.**

#### **3. In hiring, value intelligence highly. Like focus, intelligence yields increasing returns.**

#### **4. Obsess over perfection.**

#### **5. Use small details as indicators to point to the larger truth — and be alert when they point to conclusions you don’t like.**

#### **6. Don’t waste time talking about what you plan to think about; instead, work through it immediately.**

#### **7. Take the time to listen to smart people with whom you disagree.**

#### **8. Be skeptical of any sort of external allies, and don’t trust the execution of anyone outside Palantir.**

#### **9. Return to first principles and act quickly on your new conclusions.**
