# What interests me about Peter Thiel
I remember hearing about Thiel from Tim Ferriss. Ferriss hyped Thiel up and Thiel delivered. He is very contrarian and for example one of the things he says is that companies have secrets. Maybe they don't call them secrets but they are things that outsiders don't understand well. Thiel talks as if he has a few secrets and seems endlessly fascinating. For example he is a gay christian conservative venture capitalist. He used to live in San Francisco but felt like SF had become overcome with group think and he left. He talks about how startups need to create new things not just derivatives of previous ideas. His ideas have inspired me to want to become an entrepreneur.

## Views on Entrepreneurship
Peter Thiel is a strong believer in the power of entrepreneurship and innovation to drive economic growth and solve problems. He has invested in and mentored numerous startup companies, and has written and spoken extensively about the importance of taking risks and pursuing ambitious goals.

In his book "Zero to One," Thiel argues that true innovation comes from starting something new, rather than simply copying and improving upon existing ideas. He encourages entrepreneurs to focus on creating "monopolies" in their industries, rather than competing in crowded markets. According to Thiel, a monopoly is a company that is the only provider of a particular product or service, and it is able to charge higher prices and achieve greater profitability as a result.

Thiel also stresses the importance of thinking long-term and ignoring short-term distractions. He advises entrepreneurs to focus on building a strong foundation and taking a measured approach to growth, rather than trying to scale quickly and sacrificing long-term sustainability.

Overall, Thiel's views on entrepreneurship emphasize the value of taking risks, thinking creatively, and building strong, sustainable businesses.

#### Comparing the story of Romulus and Remus to Cain and Able
Romulus kill Remus to form Rome. Romulus is the victor and Rome sided with Romulus and the worldview takeaway is that life is rough and its about "survival of the fittest"
Vrs
Cain kills Able. The Bible takes the side of Able saying that Cain was wrong and the takeaway is that things are not right in the world and "we need justice"

# Lessons from Peter Thiel
[Joe Lonsdale on Thiel](https://joelonsdale.com/lessons-peter-thiel/) | April, 11 2010

The nine lessons:

#### **1. Divide reasoning into separate parts and clearly identify the most important factor.**

#### **2. Don’t divide your attention: focusing on one thing yields increasing returns for each unit of effort.**

#### **3. In hiring, value intelligence highly. Like focus, intelligence yields increasing returns.**

#### **4. Obsess over perfection.**

#### **5. Use small details as indicators to point to the larger truth — and be alert when they point to conclusions you don’t like.**

#### **6. Don’t waste time talking about what you plan to think about; instead, work through it immediately.**

#### **7. Take the time to listen to smart people with whom you disagree.**

#### **8. Be skeptical of any sort of external allies, and don’t trust the execution of anyone outside Palantir.**

#### **9. Return to first principles and act quickly on your new conclusions.**
