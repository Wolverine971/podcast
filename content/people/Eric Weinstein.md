Great podcast with Peter Thiel called [An Era of Stagnation & Universal Institutional Failure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9f0W2KD5s)


Talks about:
Embedded growth obligation: we assume growth will continue, therefore we lie and say it is
Kafabe: the fact or convention of presenting staged performances as genuine or authentic
Doesn't like string theory, says it ["is likely the greatest intellectual bubble in history"](https://twitter.com/EricRWeinstein/status/1035972081211473920)
