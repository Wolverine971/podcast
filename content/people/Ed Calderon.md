# What interests me about Ed Calderon
A buddy of mine who is in Special Forces told me to check this guy out. I listened to several podcasts he has been on and was blown away by his experiences and the things he shared. Listening to him makes me appreciate the peace and safety I regularly enjoy, and serves as a warning for me to not get too comfortable.
