# What interests me about James Altucher
I stumbled on his book "Skip the Line." I loved the title, the idea, and the mental exercise of thinking though how one would "skip the line" in different situations and domains. I listened to the preview of it on audible and I was hooked. He has some great ideas in that book and I came to find out that he wrote similar books previously. I don't know if think his books are best sellers but I love his honesty and humility in talking about his life and things he has learned along the way. He doesn't come off as an "expert" but as a hustler, a seeker, a real person with relatable problems who wants to let you in on the things he has learned if you are willing to listen. And he is someone who I think is worth listening to
# Notes and resources
Wrote a bunch of books, but I really liked "Skip the Line" 

Ideas mentioned:
- Microskills- There is no skill of business. The skill of Business is composed of many subskills or microskills. Negotiation, sales, accounting, brainstorming, researching, managing, public speaking and so on. Being good at business means you are good at a bunch of microskills.
- Plus Minus Equals- Who do you look up to, who are your peers or competitors, and who are the people you are helping or mentoring.
- who are you, why, why now
- The possibility muscle- Thinking creatively is a like a muscle that needs to be trained. The more you engage your creativity by coming up with ideas the better you will become at it.
- Idea calculus- What ideas can be combined
- Frame control- Its the idea of how a conversation or interaction is being controlled. Its how questions are posed, how the conversation is directed. Usually a person is trying to lead you down a train of thought. That person is controlling the frame of the conversation.
- Find the conspiracy number- How many things have to go right for your idea to succeed.
- Spoke and wheel- In business, what ideas play off each other? What is the main idea that a bunch of sub ideas can spawn off of?
- The incerto technique- Its about dealing with uncertainty and managing risk, learn about the premisce of each of the books in The Incerto- by Nassim Taleb
