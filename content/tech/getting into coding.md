# Overview
Learning how to code is about learning systems. You are learning how to create them, change them and what kinds there are. You are learning what goes in and what comes out. Its a creative endeavor and its complicated. But again its about creating.

## Principles to keep in mind
Consider how you are looking at a system. Are you looking at it from a high level or a low level. Sometimes you need to zoom out and look at things from a high level, and sometimes you need to zoom in and examine details at a low level. Be flexible in zooming in and out from high level to low level.
- From a frontend perspective it is all about what the user can do. What can the User Interface with (UI), how is the experience for the User (UX). The frontend enables users to do things.
- From a backend perspective it is all about CRUD operations. You CREATE READ UPDATE DELETE data. There is a lot of complexity there but that is the basis for what you are doing on the backend.


## Here is a path that I would recommend 
<span style="color: #21a0f3"> Can be completed in ~14 weeks</span>
  
  1. Learn HTML and CSS- Easy <span style="color: #21a0f3">- 2 hours</span>
	  1. Get an overview- you don't need to memorize this, you need familiarity
	  2. Resource- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/html-css)
  2. Learn Javascript- Medium <span style="color: #21a0f3">- 16 hours</span>
	  1. You need to practice, this is where you need to learn how things work
	  2. Learn basic data structures
		  1. Strings, Objects, Arrays, Integers, Booleans
	  3. Learn about functions
		  1. Syntax and built in data structure functions
	  4. Learn about loops and flow control
		  1. For Loops, and if else statements
	  5. Learn about separation of concerns
		  1. Practice passing data around, from one function to the next
  3. Learn about CRUD operations <span style="color: #21a0f3">- 2 hours</span>
     1. 1. Create Read Update Delete data
  4. Build a blog- Project <span style="color: #21a0f3">- 1-2 weeks, ~40 hours</span>
	  1. Build it from start to finish, implement the CRUD operations
	  2. Be able to see multiple blog posts and click into the blog post
	  3. Create and edit a blog post
	  4. Post comments to the blog post
	  5. Instead of a server use [browser storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API/Using_the_Web_Storage_API) for everything
	  6. There is a lot of hidden complexity here which is why you should try to build it from start to finish
  5. Now learn about Frontend JS and CSS frameworks <span style="color: #21a0f3">- 1-2 weeks, ~24 hours</span>
     1. This is advanced but I recommend briefly exploring each of these frame works and setting up a hello world
     2. Compare <span style="color: #42b883;">Vue</span>, <span style="color: #DD0031">Angular</span>, and <span style="color: #61dafb">React</span>
	  3. Learn about modules and components
	  4. Explore the command line interface (most frameworks have a CLI)
	  5. CSS- Material UI, Bootstrap, Tailwind
	  6. Just try to pick out the differences
  6. Learn about servers <span style="color: #21a0f3">- 1-2 weeks, ~24 hours</span>
     1. This is completely different from everything else you learned so make note to do a mental reset
	  2. Start a <span style="color: #026e00">Node</span> server
	  3. Use the express framework (it's the easiest to get started)
  7. Learn about APIs <span style="color: #21a0f3">- 1 week, ~24 hours</span>
	  1. Rest Apis, and <span style="color: #e10098">GraphQL</span> apis
	  2. Make Api calls, realize that GET, POST, UPDATE, DELETE methods correspond to the CRUD operations
  8. Learn about databases <span style="color: #21a0f3">- 2 week, ~48 hours</span>
     1. This is completely different from everything else you learned so make note to do a mental reset
     2. SQL and NoSQL
     3. Start with Mongo, then move to Postgres
  9.  Rebuild the blog, and host it <span style="color: #21a0f3">- 2-4 weeks</span>
	  1. Build out API with the CRUD operations
	  2. Store data
	  3. Use a frontend framework
	  4. Build out authentication, and keep track of users- hard
	  5. Take in subscribers and store the emails to a google spreadsheet

This is a starting road map. If you accomplish the above you can get a job as a software engineer and you are well on your way.
