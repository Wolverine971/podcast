# Spoiler Warning, We are Different

Peter Thiel is a famous investor and intellectual icon and has this famous question he ask founders before he invests in them:
> What important truth do very few people agree with you on?

For me, I would say that I think most people think we are all superficially different but fundamentally the same, but the opposite is true. 

> We are superficially the same but fundamentally we are very different

We are all the same in that we all more or less subscribe to maslow's hierarchy of needs. In order of precedence they are:
1. We have physical needs
2. We need to feel safe
3. We need love and belonging
4. We need to feel good about ourselves
5. We need to accomplish things

In these ways, yes we are all the same on some level. I would call these superficial in that we would not relate to one another or draw an identity from these basic needs. Such as:
1. Oh you need food and shelter, me too!
2. Oh you need to feel safe, me too!
3. Oh you need to feel loved, me too!
4. Oh you need to feel good about yourself, me too!
5. Oh you need to accomplish things, me too!

If we were to relate on this level it could be reasonably said that we are relating on a basic level.

**Where it gets interesting and how go about getting these needs fulfilled.** Or put another way, what strategies to we employ to get our basic needs met.

# People don't know or think about this

For example, what strategies might someone employ to get the first need met, the need to have their physical needs met. 
1. You could band with others and mooch off of them, by providing them something useful
2. You could think about ways to have your needs met and make plans accordingly
3. You could act immediately seeking to become self sufficient though building and gathering what you need

Now all these are linked and related- 
- Choose 1, band with others, you will probably be involved in building and gathering (3), and someone will have to make plans (2)
- Choose 2, make plans, you will eventually have to go out and gather and build (3), and you might have to band with others (1)
- Choose 3, become self sufficient, you will have to think and make plans (2), and it maybe hard to do it all yourself in the beginning so you will probably need help (1)

But what would you spend most of your time on?
Would you put more time into banding with others, thinking and making plans or actually doing the work of building?

### If you chose 1- band with others
##### How would others accept you? How would you make yourself indispensable?
- Would seek acceptance by working really hard and being very nice?
- Would seek to be the best in the group so that others admire you?
- Would you try to bring something unique and valuable to the group?

### If you chose 2- think and make plans
##### What would you think about? How would you go about making good plans?
- Would you seek to understand everything about the environment, gathering all information you can, so as to make the best plan?
- Would you seek to identify pitfalls and avoid making mistakes, so that the plan makes everyone safe while having their needs met?
- Would focus on the best way to get the most resources so that everyone can enjoy a bounty and avoid scarcity?

### If you chose 3- act and become self-sufficient
##### How would you go about becoming self sufficient? What would you do first?
- Would you seek to put in the work so that you could get everything you needed, overcoming challenges as the arise?
- Would you seek to gather your resources so that you can live comfortably while keeping peace with others
- Would you seek to go about gathering resources in the most efficiently  while organizing as you go so that your efforts are balanced


These strategies are complicated and say something about who we are as people. These strategies are derived from personality descriptions coming from a personality system called the "**enneagram**." 

There are many combinations and layers to how we approach life. You may think everyone should be an "act now and be self sufficient person", but you may be talking to a "thing and make plans" person. And they don't think its wise for you to act without stopping to think first. And you may not think that you are losing valuable time stopping to think when you can act and think on the fly.

And both of you think the "band together person" is useless because they are just mooching off of you hard work and carefully laid plans. While the "band together person" is thinking "y'all are dumb, me and my friends already got everything we need."


Ideally we should all go about gathering resources nicely, admirably, uniquely, wisely, carefully, positively,  strongly, easy-goingly, and organizedly. But we usually optimize for one or value one more, or just revert down to one strategy. If we cant agree on the best way to go about gathering resources. Why should we expect everyone to agree with us on _______. People are optimizing for things maybe you are not.

# One last thing to blow your mind
This may seem like common sense after you think about it but its in plain sight we just don't really talk it or think about how we are different in these terms. But this stuff is really old. 

 Socrates and Plato talked about how the human soul consists of, Reason, Emotions and Appetites which kinda maps to intellectual emotional and instinctual intelligence. And the Bible talks about the fruit of the Spirit which are love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. They map to the enneagram like this:\
 - Type 1- goodness
 - Type 2-love
 - Type 3- kindness
 - Type 4-gentleness
 - Type 5- patience
 - Type 6-faithfulness
 - Type 7- joy
 - Type 8-self-control
 - Type 9- peace
