description: "Both philosophers and psychologists keep stumbling around the ideas surrounding the enneagram"

In most Enneagram circles when people talk about the origins of the Enneagram they talk about Oscar Ichazo and Claudio Naranjo. In those discussions the Enneagram gets linked to Buddhism, Taoism, the metaphysical and one can easily go down a mysticism rabbit hole. However what few people talk about or have not realized is that the enneagram's ideas have deeper historical links to early philosophy and psychology.

The Enneagram is a personality typing system that describes nine distinct types of individuals, each with their own unique characteristics and tendencies. At the core of the Enneagram are the ideas of the "head," "heart," and "instincts," which are believed to shape an individual's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. These concepts align nicely with Sigmund Freud and his theory of the psyche, which includes the concepts of the id, ego, and superego.

Freud's id represents the primitive and instinctual desires of an individual, which can be likened to the Enneagram's concept of instincts. The ego, on the other hand, is the rational and decision-making aspect of the psyche, which corresponds to the Enneagram's idea of the head. Finally, the superego represents the moral and ethical aspect of the psyche, which aligns with the Enneagram's concept of the heart.

However, the origins of these ideas can be traced even further back to the philosophy of Plato. In his works, Plato describes the human soul as being composed of three parts: reason, spirit, and appetite. The rational aspect of the soul, or reason, corresponds to the Enneagram's concept of the head, while the spirited aspect of the soul, or spirit, aligns with the Enneagram's idea of the heart. Finally, the appetitive aspect of the soul, or appetite, corresponds to the Enneagram's concept of instincts.


| Freud     | Plato    | Enneagram Center of Intelligence | Enneagram Core Emotion |
| --------- | -------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| id        | appetite | instinctual/ body                | anger                  |
| ego       | reason   | intellectual/ head               | fear                   |
| super ego | spirit   | emotional/ heart                 | shame                  |

Both Freud and Plato discuss the interplay of the of these three eerily similar forces. For Plato these forces played upon the soul and for Freud these forces played upon the psyche. In enneagram circles these forces form our personality and archetypes have been discovered which people have learned from and have endlessly discussed.

In conclusion, the Enneagram's ideas of the head, heart, and instincts can be traced back to the work of Sigmund Freud and his theory of the psyche, and even further back to the philosophy of Plato and his concept of the human soul. Each of these theories emphasizes the importance of understanding the different aspects of the human psyche and how they shape our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.
