title: "The Paradox of Perception: Seeing Broadly, Yet Barely Scratching the Surface"
description: "Explore the paradox of our digital age: abundant information yet shallow understanding. Dive deeper with us into the power of curiosity."

In an era where information is abundant and connections are a click away, we find ourselves in a paradoxical situation. We can see broadly, yet we struggle to see deeply. We are like sailors adrift in an ocean of knowledge, with no compass to guide us. This blog post is an exploration of this paradox, a journey into the depths of our collective curiosity, or lack thereof.

### The Paradox of Perception

We live in a time where our relationships often feel superficial. We are the most advanced humans to ever exist, yet we struggle to connect on a profound level. How did we get here? What mechanisms shaped this reality? What does this mean for our future, and what can we do about it?

The paradox of our perception is most evident when we look at technology. We are constantly connected via our phones and the internet. We can contact anyone, anytime, anywhere. Yet, how many of us genuinely check in on more than a handful of people every week? How many people genuinely check in on us?

### The Illusion of Knowledge

The internet has given us access to an unprecedented amount of information. As Elon Musk once said, "you don't need college to learn stuff" because knowledge is available basically for free. Yet, how many of us are truly leveraging the internet to gain deep knowledge?

We can find answers and resources for any question or topic that crosses our minds. We can directly call, text, or email anyone at any time. We can quickly access information about them through various social media platforms. This gives us the illusion of understanding the world and the people in it. But if we were to ask ourselves how many people we truly know on a deep level, the number would likely be small.

### The Danger of Labels

We constantly label those around us. Smart or dumb, kind or mean, funny or annoying, attractive or unattractive, strong or weak, friend or foe. These labels help us classify others, but do they help us understand them?

When we label people, we risk clouding our judgment and seeking confirmation bias in the future. We all know what it's like to be judged prematurely or have an unwarranted label thrust upon us. We wish others knew the full picture, understood our intent, and knew the real us.

### The Power of Curiosity

The key to seeing deeply lies in curiosity. The word "curiosity" comes from the Latin word cūriōsus, meaning “careful” or “inquisitive.” Those who are curious are careful not to assume or jump to conclusions. They are diligent in observing all aspects of a thing, looking under the nooks and crannies for anything amiss.

As Aaron Swartz once said, "What people call intelligence, just boils down to curiosity." And Albert Einstein famously stated, "I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious."

### The Quest for Authenticity

In today's world, there's a lot of talk about being authentic or congruent. Say what you mean and mean what you say. Don't try to hide your thoughts or feelings. Don't be fake. Speak your truth. Be real. Allow yourself to be seen, really seen.

But how can you speak your truth if you don't know your truth? In order to be authentic, one must know oneself. As Socrates said, "know thyself." And ironically, he also proclaimed, "I know that I know nothing." This duality of seeking to know oneself and knowing that one knows nothing is the state of curiosity.

### Wrapping up

In the age of information, we can see broadly but struggle to see deeply. We have access to a wealth of knowledge, yet we often lose ourselves in the noise. The antidote to this chaos lies in curiosity, in seeking to understand rather than simply to know.

As Matthew 7:7 says, "Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you." So let's start asking, seeking, and knocking. Let's start seeing deeply.

Remember, the world is full of wonders waiting to be discovered. All it takes is a little curiosity. As Albert Einstein once said, "I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious." Let's embrace our curiosity and start seeing deeply.

## We can see broadly but not deeply. 

#### Intro and implications
When most of our relationships feel superficial what should we do? 
We are the most advanced humans to ever exist with   How does this happen? What or whom is to blame? What mechanisms shaped or allowed this to happen. What does this say about the future and what can be done about it? All this and more to follow.

Being able to see broadly and not deeply manifests is evident when you scan technology. We are constantly connected via our phones and the ever present internet. With your phone you can contact via call text or email anyone you know, and some people you don't. Like wise, people you know and don't know are constantly trying to contact you. We could contact anyone we know and ask them how their day was, yet we might checkup on only a handful of people every week. How many people try to check in with us, every week or month... other than your mom. No one other than maybe your mom cares deeply about what you are thinking, feeling, or what you did. 

The other thing is the internet. The internet connects us to information. We search the internet for what we are looking for, or to get an answer to a question we just had. Almost anything we want to know is at our fingertips. Elon Musk is quoted as saying that "you don't need college to learn stuff" and that knowledge is available basically for free. Yet how many of us are leveraging the internet to gain the same level of knowledge that would be attained in a college class? 

As far a social media, suffice to say it is entertainment masking as life u
We won't touch on social media because the negative impacts should be self evident but suffice to say 

You can call or text anyone you know and people you don't know. People who you don't know constantly ping you. People email you, companies email you, when you purchase something you can get texted or emailed a receipt. You are connected. You are also bobarded and overwhelmed by noise, we need signal.

The realization that we can see broadly and not deeply is made possible when we start exploring

We can see broadly in that we can find answers and resources for any question or topic that crosses your mind.  The internet and the cell phone combine to make information literally at our fingertip. With relationships we can directly call, text, or email them at anytime. Indirectly we can quickly access information about them through:
- Twitter
- Instagram
- Facebook
- Youtube channel 
- Twitch
- Tumblr
- A Blog
- Googling them.

With all this information and access at our fingertips this gives us the illusion of understanding the world, the people in our lives and most other people in general. But if you were to ask yourself how many people know you on a deep level, I bet the number would be small. On a deep level how many people can we say that we actually know? How deeply can we know someone after having...
- personally known the person for years
- had a long conversation with them
- had listened hours and hours to their podcasts
- stalked them for online

We might have gathered some facts about them, learned about their views, and even know how they will react in some situations. However what percentage would you put on knowing the entirety of a person. What percentage do you think most people would put on knowing the entirety of you versus what percentage they actually know of you. 

I would guess there is a disparity between what people think they know about a person and what is actually true about a person. But that does not slow us down in drawing conclusions about a person based off of observed behavior.

We constantly label those around us. 
- smart or dumb 
- kind or mean
- funny or annoying
- attractive or unattractive 
- strong or weak
- friend or foe

Those are just some of the safely tame labels. Are these labels helping us classify others. Do these classifications help us navigate our relationships? Doubt it.

We must be careful to not place too much trust in that one data point for it may cloud our judgment causing us to look for confirmation bias in future. Most of us know what it is like to be judged prematurely or have an unwarranted label thrust upon us or one action taken out of context. How many times do we wish others
- had the full picture of situation
- knew my intent
- knew the real me

What is worth pointing out is that when we label people after either observing or hearing about them in a situation
with them that warrants a label. We have a data point on a situation. However what else do we have data on? How will data collection in the future 

Still, we have only found out things in areas we have explored. And though we may know a lot about that person their self image probably does not completely match your understanding of them.

People only show you the parts they want to show you. And we dont have time for people who dont agree with us or see the world the way do. We see the world the right way the way it truly is.

People now a days talk about how we should be [authentic](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/click-here-happiness/201904/develop-authenticity-20-ways-be-more-authentic-person) or [congruent](https://liveyourlegend.net/the-beginners-guide-to-being-congruent/):
- Say what you mean and mean what you say
- Don't try to hide your thoughts or feelings
- Don't be fake
- Wear your emotions on your sleeve
- Speak your truth
- Be real
- Allow yourself to be seen, really seen -- #people/BreneBrown

How then can you speak your truth if you don't know your truth and in order to not be fake we must know the real us. It follows that in order to be authentic one must as Socrates said **"know thyself"**. And ironically he also was fond of proclaiming  **"[I know that I know nothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_that_I_know_nothing "I know that I know nothing")"**. 

This irony and duality of someone seeking to know thyself and also knowing that they know nothing is special. It is the state in which you are curious. Curious about yourself and about what you don't know. In a curious state you are listening, paying attention, seeking to understand. The word **curiosity**, comes from the Latin word cūriōsus, meaning “careful” or “inquisitive.” Those who curious are careful not to assume or jump to conclusions, and the word careful comes from the Latin word "diligens" which is where we get the word diligent. Those who are careful are diligent to observe all aspects of a thing, look under the nooks and crannies for anything amiss. Careful is also a synonym for being cautious as in aware of danger. 

All these descriptions and peripheral synonyms surrounding "curiosity" are needed in order to see deep.
