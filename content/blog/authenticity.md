Anyone can put out a message and craft it to be what they want it.
Authenticity is going to become more important. People are going to seek places that they feel are authentic.


I haven't read "Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook" by  Gary Vaynerchuk but I heard it was good. In the last bullet point of this post talking about takeaways from the book, it says "Brands are fatally thinking of social media as a distribution channel rather than a storytelling channel." This feels so true to me. People are just gonna put out content thinking that more is better, and with these AI tools its just going to make it easier to put out content. What will differentiate content is the storytelling and those that tell authentic stories will be increasingly both rare and sought after.
