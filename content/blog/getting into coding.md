# Overview
Learning how to code is about learning about systems. You are learning how to create them, change them, what kinds there are, you are learning what goes in and what comes out. Its a creative endeavor and its complicated. But again its about creating.



Here is a path that I would recommend.
  
  1. Learn HTML and CSS- Easy- 
	  1. Resource- https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/html-css
  2. Learn Javascript- Hard
	  1. Learn basic data structures
		  1. Strings, Objects, Arrays, Integers, Booleans
	  2. Learn about functions
		  1. Syntax and built in data structure functions
	  3. Learn about loops and flow control
		  1. For Loops, and if else statements
	  4. Learn about separation of concerns
		  1. Practice passing data around, from one function to the next
  3. Build a blog- Project
	  1. From start to finish
	  2. Be able to see multiple blog posts and click into the blog post
	  3. Create and edit a blog post
	  4. Post comments to the blog post
	  5. Use browser storage for everything
  4. Now learn about Frontend JS and CSS frameworks
	  1. This is advanced but I recommend briefly exploring each of these frame works and setting up a hello world
	  2. Compare Vue, Angular, and React
	  3. Learn about modules and components
	  4. Explore the CLI
	  5. CSS- Material UI, Bootstrap, Tailwind
	  6. Just try to pick out the differences
  5. Learn about servers-
	  1. Start a node server
	  2. Use express
  6. Learn about APIs
	  1. Rest Apis, and GraphQl apis
  7. Learn about databases
	  1. SQL and NoSQL
	  2. Start with Mongo, then move to Postgres
  9. Rebuild the blog, and host it
	  1. Build out API with crud functions
	  2. Store data
	  3. Use a frontend framework
	  4. Build out authentication, and keep track of users- hard
	  5. Take in subscribers and store the emails to a google spreadsheet

This is a starting road map. If you accomplish the above you can get a job as a software engineer and you are well on your way.
