> ## How I approached leaving the military
> When thinking about all the paths I could take when leaving the military the main thing I wanted was autonomy. I was tired of listening to bad leaders, of feeling stuck and thinking I could do it better if I just got the chance. I figured the only person who had that freedom would be the boss of a company.
>
>I knew no one is going to make me the boss of anything. I would need to be working at a company for 5-10 years in order to be given a decent amount of responsibility and autonomy. If I went to college its going to take 4 years to get a degree, and I will just be starting out a career a little ahead of those who don't have a degree. 
>
>Both seemed like bad options to me and I was searching for a better way. I had been reading Tim Ferris's books and [blog](https://tim.blog/).  He is a self proclaimed life hacker. He has great ideas and interviews a lot of people from various backgrounds, so I started zeroing in on the business people he had interviewed. It was broad generic advice at first but 
>
>So then I went down a path asking questions about what does it take to run a company anyway? You need a product or a service and a way to sell it and there should be a need for it in the market. Ok so then I start thinking what can I make or sell? What is going on in the "market"? 
>
>Two things stuck out to me:
>- In starting a business, ideas are a dime a dozen. Many people can come up with great ideas. The hard part is the actual execution.
>- Technical people have a better chance of success than non technical people.
>
>
>I didn't understand all of what those tidbits implied but I landed on deciding that I need to become technical so that I can build something and execute on all my great ideas. In researching how to become "technical" I knew I needed to learn how to build websites and apps and I could go to college to get a computer science degree. But there was also another path, I could go to a coding bootcamp. I didn't know much about them but I went to a job fair and met someone who was a veteran and had gone through a coding bootcamp and was now trying to start his own business. He was scrappy, up beat and his energy matched mine. I wanted to go down the path he was going rather than the path of some college student. Later on I found out he had also been a Marine Corps recruiter but it didn't matter, I was buying what he was selling!
>
>The bootcamp program would be 6 months long and they said graduates usually get a job within 3 months and make on average 70k starting out. That sounded good to me. I could use my Gi-Bill to pay for the bootcamp, now I just needed a place to stay. I attended one of the bootcamp's meetups and met someone else who was about to graduate the program and was looking for roommates. Perfect! I moved in.
>
>Today I am working as a software engineer at a startup where I like what I do and have a lot of autonomy. Still incubating a few startup ideas on the side, but I feel like I made the ideal transition and I would like to share my learnings. So much could have gone wrong on the path that I took and not everything went according to plan, but I feel like I was directionally correct. Looking back if I was going to reverse engineer an ideal outcome while taking into account all the lessons learned, I would take this approach.

## Strategy Overview
At the end of this we should be directionally correct. We are going to take is to look at things from a high level/ big picture view then work our way down to low level/ tactical view. By the end you should have a path created or at least have a direction to head.


### 1. Establish High Level Goals
Lets start by zooming out from the day to day tasks and look at what your big picture goals are. At a high level what is the career/ job and lifestyle you want to live?

Take some time to think about these high level questions:
- What do you want to do? 
- Do you want to work in a specific job or industry?
- Do you want to be in a certain location?
- What is your ideal lifestyle?
- Do you want to work with people aka talk to people daily and have multiple meetings a day? 
- Do you want autonomy, aka having the freedom to work alone and when you want?
- Do you want a lot of structure or very little structure?
- Do you need to be making a minimum amount of money?
- How much will your savings sustain you?
- Long term where do you want to be?
- What would you want your life to look like in 5 years? 10 years?

You should be able to narrow down your requirements for an ideal situation from this list. A lot of this depends on your personality so you need to assess yourself honestly. Talk to people you trust about the above questions. Ask for their feedback and ask what their plans are. If you are frustrated or lost, talk to someone and ask for help and guidance. Next step is to prioritize.

### 2. Prioritize and Analyze
Prioritize your goals. You need to balance what can be done the fastest with what will have the biggest impact. Or said another way, how fast can this goal be attained and how rewarding will this goal be once fulfilled.

Examples situations to think through:
- You may want to be a doctor. But that is a long road. 10+ years of schooling before you are making the big bucks. Is that worth it to you? Do you like school? Are you that patient? Do you have a passion for medicine? What are the stats on people making it though med school to become a doctor?
- You may want to be an influencer and do a bunch of brand deals and go to UFC fights. How long is it going to take you to build a brand? How big can you get and how big do you need to get in order to have it be a sustainable lifestyle? Have you ever produced content before? What are the stats for people that try to become influencers compared to the people that become successful at it?
- You may want to go back home and take care of the family business? Is the business growing or slowing? What is a day in the life going to look like? What kind of impact/ value are you going to bring? 

You are trying to create a doable a path. You don't need to have all the answers now because the next step is to research.

### 3. Research
Get a lay of the land for the path you want to take. Gather stats around the job/ career/ industry you want to be in. 

Ask the following questions:
- How many jobs are there, compared to other jobs in other industries?
- Where are these jobs located?
- Who are the industry leading companies?
- Who are the industry influencers and top performers?
- What makes the best the best in the job? What separates the average from the top performers?
- What does a day in the life look like?
- What do online forums have to say? Try to get the inside scoop from reddit, facebook groups and dedicated websites
- What is the normal path, the fast path, what is the best path for you?
  
Now that you are more informed about what you are perusing, now is time to reach out and get connected.

### 4. Get connected
Here the goal is to get a vibe for the job and the industry by talking to people. You are looking for practical advice for what to do from people who are actually doing what you want to do.

- Join groups
	- Subreddits
	- Facebook groups
	- Slack channels
	- Discord channels
	- Online forums
	- LinkedIn 

- DM people, take the initiative, its flattering to ask people for advice?
	- "Hey I am looking into getting into X, could I ask you some questions and pick your brain?"
- Use Linkedin, Twitter, Veterati 

Here you are looking to build connections to help keep you accountable. Which is great because these people will help you make a plan.

### 5. Plan

Develop your plan. It doesn't have to be perfect, it can be incomplete. You want to set up checkpoints and timelines. Think through the following:

- What is the end goal?
- When I reach the end goal, what is the next step?
- What is the first step?
- How long is this going to take?
- What is the most difficult part?
- What could go wrong? What is the worst case scenario?
- What is the margin of error?
- What can you be proactive about?
- How can I mitigate any risk involved?
- Who can I check in with to keep me accountable?
- Where am I going to be? What is the cost of living?
- What am I going to do for healthcare?


You don't need to have all of these questions answered but if take the steps above and consider these questions you will have a good plan and be directionally correct.

> ## This was my plan when I got out.
> - What is the end goal?
> 	- Be my own boss. Become an entrepreneur.
> - When I reach the end goal, what is the next step?
> 	- Run a sustainable business. Look to achieving higher goals.
> - What is the first step?
> 	- Research entrepreneurship, which led me to wanting to become "technical" which led me to enrolling in a coding bootcamp.
> - How long is this going to take?
> 	- Bootcamp is 6 months long, with the added 3 months projected to find a software engineering job leaves us at 9 months where things should be stable. Then as I am working I will be refining skills and learning looking for opportunities to start my own startup.
> - What is the most difficult part?
> 	- Going through the bootcamp and getting the first job.
> - What could go wrong? What is the worst case scenario?
> 	- I could fail the bootcamp then have to try something else. I could not get a job and have to pivot to something else.
> - What is the margin of error?
> 	- The bootcamp says you need no previous technical experience, so if other people with no training have succeeded, I can too. Getting a software engineering job is hard but there is a great demand for software engineers.
> - How can I mitigate risk and be proactive?
> 	- Make sure I am getting the most out of the program and learn everything that is thrown at me. Plan for where I am going to live when I finish the program as I am searching for a job.
> - Who can I check in with to keep me accountable?
> 	- Check-in in with my peers and alumni who graduated the program.
> - Where am I going to be? What is the cost of living?
> 	- I would be in LA for the bootcamp and the GI bill would pay for rent. Save up as much as I can and potentially move back home until I land my first job.

## Personal Aftermath
>I did end up moving back home and lived with my brother. And it did take about 3 months to get my first software engineering job. Looking back I didn't realize how fortunate I was to go to that bootcamp and get into tech. That decision has opened up so much and given me a lot of autonomy which is what I have been seeking all along. Given the path I chose and looking back at how far I have come it is hard to imagine a better transition experience out of the military. Tech isn't for everyone but taking time to think about what direction you want to head should be for everyone.
